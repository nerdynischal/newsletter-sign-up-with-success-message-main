## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/SCSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Practice with designing and developing forms using HTML, CSS & JS. No server to send the data too so used local storage to mimic the behaviour for this practice project.
